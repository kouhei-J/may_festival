# Why not relax while listening to choir music!

## What's a Chorus Café...?？

Chorus Café is a café where chorus singing is played and sung! Feel free to drop by and listen!

For those who love chorus singing, those who are interested, or those who used to do it in the past, please come and see us! We plan to perform mainly **familiar songs** such as the suite "Miyakowasure" (Hideki Chihara) performed at our joint concert this year and favorite songs of the Midorikai Chorus Club.

For those who honestly aren't interested in chorus singing,,, You can discover the charm of chorus singing! Since you've come to this page, how about coming our chorus café and listening to our chorus?
